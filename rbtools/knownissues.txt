commit dfed76da14d35f6652e38c55bcc78e714cbfe451

List of Known Issues:
    commands/rbpatch.py:
        -Only implemented for the git SCM.
        -Although logically this seems to be working, when the patch checks
        to see if it can apply the check fails.  This seems to be because
        the patch downloaded from the reviewboard server has some information
        stripped out of it.

Some Next Steps:
    commands/rbinfo.py:
        -This is only implemented for resources directly accessable from
        the root resource.  It needs to be extended further down the chain.
        -This would be much nicer if it could have an interactive UI
